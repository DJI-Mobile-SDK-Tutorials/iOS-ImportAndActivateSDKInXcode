In this tutorial, we will use the Xcode's "Single View Application" template project to show you how to import DJI iOS SDK and register the application.

## Downloading the SDK

  You can download DJI iOS SDK from [DJI Developer Website](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/downloads), 

## Creating the Xcode Project

  Open Xcode, select **File->New->Project** to create a new project in Xcode, choose **Single View Application** template for your project and press "Next":
  
  ![createProject](./Images/createProject.png)
  
  Then enter "ImportSDKDemo" in the **Product Name** field and keep the other default settings:
  
  ![enterProjectInfo](./Images/enterProjectInfo.png)
  
## Importing the SDK
  
  Once the project is created, let's navigate to the "FPVDemo" folder of the project and create a new folder named "Frameworks". Next copy the **DJISDK.framework**, which you just download from DJI Developer website to this folder.
  
  ![copyFrameworks](./Images/copyFrameworks.png)
  
  Next, let's come back to the Xcode project navigator and right click on the "ImportSDKDemo" and select "Add Files to "ImportSDKDemo"..." to add the "Frameworks" folder to the Xcode Project.  
  
  ![addFolders](./Images/addFolders.png)
  
 Once you import the SDK successfully, you should see the following project structure screenshot:

  ![importSDKFramework](./Images/importSDKFramework.png) 
 
 Furthermore, let's select the "ImportSDKDemo" target and open the "General" tab. In the "Embedded Binaries" section, press "+" to add the "DJISDK.framework" as shown below:
 
  ![sdkFramework](./Images/sdkFramework.png)

> **Note**:
> 
> **1.** In order to enable your app to connect to the MFI remote controller, you must add 
>  "Supported external accessory protocols" items in the info.plist file, let's modify it by adding the following content:
> 
>  ![MFI](./Images/MFIProtocol.png)
   
> **2.** Since in iOS 9, App Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load since it is insecure. You must add **App Transport Security Settings** items in the info.plist file as shown below too:
> 
>  ![appTransportSecurity](./Images/appTransportSecurity.png)

## Activating the Project

  Now, let's go to the "ViewController.m" file and import the "DJISDK.h" header file, then implement the `DJISDKManagerDelegate` protocol in the class extension part:
  
~~~objc
#import "ViewController.h"
#import <DJISDK/DJISDK.h>

@interface ViewController ()<DJISDKManagerDelegate>
@end
~~~
  
  Next, create a new method `registerApp`, invoke it in the `viewDidAppear` method as shown below:
  
~~~objc
- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];
    [self registerApp];
}

- (void)registerApp
{
    NSString *appKey = @"Enter Your App Key Here";
    [DJISDKManager registerApp:appKey withDelegate:self];
}
~~~

  In the code above, we invoke the `registerApp:withDelegate:` method of DJISDKManager to register the application on DJI Server and set "ViewController" as the delegate. Then we call the `registerApp` method in `viewDidAppear:` method when the view appear.

>**Note**: For the **App Key**, you may need to obtain it from the DJI Developer website **(<http://developer.dji.com/en/user/apps>)**.  If you are not familiar with the App Key, please check [Creating an DJI App Tutorial](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/get-started/Register-Download).

>The **App Key** we generate for you is associated with the Xcode project's **Bundle Identifier**, so you will not be able to use the same App Key in a different Xcode project. Each project must be submitted individually and will receive a unique App Key.
>

  Moreover, let's implement the `sdkManagerDidRegisterAppWithError:` delegate method to check the registration result:

~~~objc
- (void)sdkManagerDidRegisterAppWithError:(NSError *)error
{
    NSString* message = @"Register App Successed!";
    if (error) {
        message = @"Register App Failed! Please enter your App Key and check the network.";
    }else
    {
        NSLog(@"registerAppSuccess");
       [DJISDKManager startConnectionToProduct];
    }
    
    [self showAlertViewWithTitle:@"Register App" withMessage:message];
}

- (void)showAlertViewWithTitle:(NSString *)title withMessage:(NSString *)message
{
    UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:title message:message preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
    UIAlertAction *okAction = [UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"OK" style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault handler:nil];
    [alert addAction:okAction];
    [self presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
}
~~~

 If you register the app failed, you can check the **error** parameter of the  delegate method to figure out the problem. For more details, please check the **DJISDKRegistrationError** in the "NSError+DJISDK.h" file of DJISDK.

 Finally, build and run the project in Xcode using iOS Simulator. If everything goes well, you should see a "Register App Success!" alert once the application loads.
